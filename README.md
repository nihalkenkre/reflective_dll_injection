# Reflective DLL Injection

This is an implementation to reflectively load a DLL into memory.

This project is based on Stephen Fewer's [ReflectiveDLLInjection](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection) project. Please refer to it for concept level understanding, and the seminal implementation.
